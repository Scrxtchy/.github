# interactions.py

The official organization of interactions.py, the leading Discord Python library for interactions.

----

Hello there. We're interactions.py: an open-sourced software (OSS) project that specialize in making Discord interactions, a
newly released set of tools to bot developers on the platform since 2020 December easy-to-use. All repositories that are found
here are officially endorsed and affiliated to the branding of interactions.py; and its representatives. Things can look a little
confusing around here, so let's take the time together to explain what we have to offer and what's shown.

## The core

The "core" are what we consider as repositories crucial to delivering interactions.py's service. So far, the only repository we 
have under the core is `library` which is... you guessed it, our library. The team responsible for maintaining and developing
the core are known as our "core team." Whatever the term is, we'll essentially suffix it with being a team.

## 3rd parties

Our 3rd parties respectively fall under a separate term which we call "ext," a shortened way of saying external. These are the
libraries which extend off of our core library's `ext` framework, a software development kit (SDK) for bot developers to use allowing
an easy and simple DX with creating 3rd party libraries akin. Our ext team is always growing with developers coming to help create
a better experience for bot developers using our library.

### The ext philosophy

We are committed to ensuring a better and prosperous future for the Discord library OSS ecosystem here at interactions.py. Our philosophy
is fairly simple and clear: anyone can become an external developer. We openly welcome and encourage for people to develop 3rd parties
for our service, as we're all about developer collaboration. There's no reason in our mind to justify the need for discouraging or not 
putting value to the face of collaborating with one another. 

## Social media

interactions.py take the extra step in spreading their name. We recognize the importance of bot developers wanting to learn about interactions,
as well as their usefulness in the bot development community. interactions.py actively continue to spread public awareness about our library,
3rd parties and involvements with pursuing our vision.
