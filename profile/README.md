# interactions.py

The official organization of interactions.py, the leading Discord Python library for interactions.

----

Hi there! If you've stumbled across this page, then welcome: we're interactions.py. This is a library that specialises
in making Discord's interactions easy, simple, scalable and modular in bots. On the chance you're looking for a specific
repository, you might've been confused upon first glance at all there is. This front page serves to help newcomers where
and what things are listed under this organisation.

## Core

"Core" is a term that we use to describe the `library` repository: what makes interactions.py possible. If you're looking
to directly contribute new features and/or mention issues with our library, you're able to
[easily do so here.](https://github.com/interactions-py/library)

We have a team that focus purely on developing the library, known as the "core development team." You're able to find our
core developers in our [Discord support server.](https://discord.gg/interactions)

## Ext

"Ext" is another term that we use to describe extensions. Extensions are a paradigm that the library offers with helping
allow more modular and scalable code either through the use of an object-orientation; and/or imports. Our ext development
team are responsible for helping maintain these 3rd parties officially endorsed by interactions.py's branding.

Extensions are typically made by the community and endorsed upon recognition of their status by use from the community
and other internal standards which are not disclosed unless interest has been expressed by the core development team.

### Philosophy

The philosophy of extensions is quite simple: if you can create an extension, you have a fair chance at getting it added.
Whether you're creating extensions with the intent of having it endorsed by interactions.py, or simply to help with you 
and others' bots, we openly welcome and accept bringing these on board through our emphasised interest on open-sourced collaboration.

## Marketing

interactions.py places great emphasis in getting its name out there to the Discord bot development community, which is handled
by our marketing team. The marketing team is mostly responsible for communal relations, but additionally collaborate with partners
and act as the spokesperson of the brand.
